In this study, we are inferring the behaviour for the Big Five personality traits through the Instagram data. For this analysis, we are using the Shared Images, Content of the posts and Key Performance Indicators for each post.

Usually, people will adjust the appearance of the images and then post it. So this assessment helps to understand the type of filters &amp; colors is opting by each personality.

The investigation is ap-proached by implementing the different categorical algorithm and validating the model accuracy. Fi-nally, with the help of metrics, we could understand the activeness &amp; social interaction for each per-sonality traits. The regression model is used to extract Features from the quantitative data.
